        <p>As an explorer soul, as soon as she arrived in the Dominican Republic, she put herself to the task of traveling the whole country. Initially, she was pretty surprised by all the things she had heard about the Dominican Republic. Since it is an island, she was not expecting the country to have such a diverse range of environments. 

          The first thing that people think of when someone mentions the Dominican Republic is its beautiful beaches, but the small country has a lot more to offer, including multiple rivers, cold environments, and numerous mountains, as well as an attractive and diverse culture that features various architectural styles and constructions. 

          Fortunately, for her, one of her hobbies is running long distances, which allows her to reach her destinations, such as the top of a mountain or the end of a path. This led her to start running marathons to keep exploring new views.
