          <p>
            Ana was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1983, the capital city of the country. Even though her birth was not a surprise, her parents were not financially ready to have a baby, on top of certain medical complications from her mother's side, which made her childhood incredibly difficult. Years later, her sister Kilma came into the world, bringing her a companion and a friend to share the world. However, at that moment, it made it more challenging for both parents to sustain the family. Five Years later, the last component of the family arrived, Darwin, a little boy who became the toy of those two beautiful children. After Darwin arrived, her parent realized that living in the capital city was too much for them, and decided to move to a smaller city called Guarenas, where things finally started to improve. 
            By the time she finished High school, she already knew what she wanted to study in college: business administration. She completed her associate's degree in just two years. With a degree, her professional career started at Mercantil, the bank where she worked for 14 years of her life. Just a couple of years after earning her associate's degree, she began her bachelor's in business administration while working at the bank, and she completed it in record time.

            As soon as she started working, she was able to provide support for the family, which led to a significant improvement for the whole family. The same wave became bigger when her sister, Kilma, graduated from college as a lawyer and followed suit. Finally, that wave became a tsunami when Darwin was able to collaborate. 
            Ana's family was able to buy a main house where everyone lived, as well as two additional houses to emancipate herself and her sister, Kilma. Unfortunately, the political situation in Venezuela destroyed the economy, and the country was no longer able to provide safety for her family, which forced her and her siblings to look for a better future. Darwin and Kilma left the country first, heading to the United States. One year later, Ana and her parents were able to move to the Dominican Republic with the support of her siblings in the US. 
            Now in the Dominican Republic, Ana is finally able to enjoy her life and do the things she enjoys, while offering a good quality of life to her parents, who are 71 years old.
