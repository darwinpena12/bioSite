          <img src="images/ana%203.png" alt="History">
          <p>Meet Ana, a Venezuelan girl who moved to the Dominican Republic to reconnect with her roots. 
            Ana was born and raised in Venezuela by her parents, Dania and Anastasio, 
            two immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Later in her life, the whole family 
            was forced to abandon Venezuela due to the catastrophe caused by the political party in control. </p>
          <p>Ana decided to return with her parents to her parents' homeland and start anew. 
            Fortunately, she had a couple of tools that enabled her to make a smooth transition; 
            one of them was a bachelor's degree in business administration, the second was over 15 years of 
            experience working for Mercantil, one of the largest banks in Venezuela and the third one 
            was that the Venezuelan culture is similar to the Dominican culture, specially 
            from a relegious standpoint. </p>

          <p>Ana left Venezuela in 2018 to achieve financial stability, better working opportunities, 
            and access to food and healthcare supplies; all these goals have been achieved already. 
            Her goals now are to advance to a floor manager position in her current workplace, 
            achieve a healthy body shape to prevent potential health conditions such as high cholesterol or 
            diabetes, travel as much as she can to the Dominican Republic, and reconnect with her faith.</p>
          <p>Recently, her boyfriend proposed to her, and they are soon to be married in 2026. 
            They plan to get married in the church where they met and travel to multiple beaches and 
            tourist destinations in the Dominican Republic to celebrate their honeymoon. 
            They also share many goals, such as buying a house. </p>
        </div>

        <p>With love, all the family is proud of you, Ana Rosa. </p>
